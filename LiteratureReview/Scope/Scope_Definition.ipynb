    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document defines the scope of the MSc dissertation titled:  \n",
    "**Adversarial Attacks on AI-Based Biometric Authentication Systems: Detection and Defence in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to break the topic into clear, manageable components for implementation, evaluation, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Research Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Domain**: AI-based biometric authentication, focusing on facial recognition  \n",
    "- **Security Concern**: Adversarial attacks that lead to unauthorised access or rejection  \n",
    "- **Research Problem**: How can adversarial attacks be detected and mitigated in practical settings?  \n",
    "- **Target Audience**: Developers and organisations, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who require security but may lack specialist AI knowledge\n",
