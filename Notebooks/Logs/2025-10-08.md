**Baseline Model, FGSM Adversarial Attack & JPEG Defence Implementation**

## Summary

Today focused on validating an adversarial pipeline using a **pretrained FaceNet model** applied to the **LFW dataset**. This setup simulates the kind of biometric authentication system an SME might rely on. 

We developed a baseline adversarial test flow with three stages:
1. **Correct classification** of an image using the pretrained model.
2. **FGSM attack** applied to generate a minimally perturbed adversarial image.
3. **JPEG compression defence** to recover performance after the attack.

## What the Baseline Code Does

- Loads LFW dataset and passes a face image through a **pretrained FaceNet** model.
- Measures cosine similarity between the **original image's embedding** and:
  - The **FGSM-attacked image**
  - The **JPEG-compressed recovery of the adversarial image**
- If the clean image is not correctly classified, the attack and defence steps are skipped.

Cosine similarity values indicate how "alike" the model sees the images.  
**Higher = more similar**, and **lower = successful attack**.

## Example Result

✅ Correct Prediction Found: George_W_Bush
⚠️ Adversarial Prediction: Colin_Powell
🎯 Cosine similarity (original vs adv): 0.41
🔧 Cosine similarity (original vs JPEG-defended): 0.82


This shows:
- The FGSM attack was successful.
- JPEG compression partially recovered the original identity in the model’s embedding space.

## Why This Matters for SMEs

- Training your own model is **time-consuming** and **resource-intensive**. We've seen losses stay >8 even after 20 batches when training from scratch.
- **Pretrained models** offer a head start, but they are still vulnerable to attack.
- Lightweight defences like **JPEG compression** are accessible and don’t require deep ML knowledge, making them ideal for **SME deployment**.

---

## What Should Happen

1. Clean image → correctly classified
2. FGSM perturbed image → misclassified
3. JPEG defence → classification improves OR cosine similarity increases

This flow shows how vulnerable models are in production and helps SMEs assess trade-offs between robustness and implementation complexity.

---

## Issues / Challenges

- Sometimes no correctly classified image is found in batch → pipeline is skipped.
- Cosine similarity and predictions need further benchmarking for different ε values.
- Need to improve result tracking + evaluation outputs for each defence.

---

## Next

- Improve batch selection and metrics tracking.
- Test other lightweight defences (e.g. Gaussian blur, cropping).
- Finalise baseline notebook and begin literature review writing.
